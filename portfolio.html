            This is just a quick introduction page to show you some of my skills
            and a few of the projects that I have worked on. Technologies used:
            HTML5, CSS, Javascript.

            <h3 style="text-align:left;margin-left:15%">2.) "Lister"</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
        Developed by myself and my Codercamps classmates Joe Waynick and Suzanne
        Federico. Using the "Agile Methodology", we worked as a small Dev Team and
        created this very powerful business tool! Lister is a web app that can be
        used by any online entrepreneur who wishes to leverage the power of Amazon
        to sell products. Lister interfces with Amazon's complex API and makes it
        much faster and easier to upload and list your products for sale. This app
        will save you many hours weekly, and free up your time to do all of the other
        important business processes you might have on your agenda. Technologies used:
        MS Visual Studio, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript (Angular library),
        Typescript, and C#.

            This is my first published Website.  Prior to my decision to go to school
            for Web Development, I was partial owner of this business. While this
            business is still in operation, I am no longer involved. I did however
            seize the opportunity to practice my newly acquired Developer skills by
            designing the company's website.  Initially I wrote all of the code using
            MS Visual Studio. But since there was not any business needs for functioning
            Back-End databases, I rewrote the code using the Atom text editor.
            Technologies Used: HTML5, CSS, and Javascript.
