            This is a GoDaddy design project I worked on. As the Design Agent I consulted
            many hours with Customer, and I also did all of the revision build work myself.

           This GoDaddy design project was a Makeover that the Customer was unsatified with. Initially
           he asked for a refund due to the folowing issues. 1.) Poor arrangement of products. 2.)
           Confusing arrangement of the product descriptions and titles. 3.) Product images (over 60 total)
           were severely cropping, and made them look very unprofessional. 4.) The Customer had issues
           with how the logo and company name were displaying in the header. 5.) The Customer also wanted
           some of the information removed from the footer.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a long consutation with this Customer, I decided to do the revison build and fix the issues
          myself. The revison summary was over 300 minutes of Build time. When I presented the completed
          result to the Customer, he agreed that the project had now met his standard and asked me to have
          published immediately. This project is copyrighted by "Mulburytree.com" and "GoDaddy Design Services".

          This Customer waited a long time (almost a year) to decide what to do about this after recieving
          his rough draft. Ultimately he decided that he wants a completely different look than what the orginal
          template was set to. We have spent many hours consulting and desining togather to get this to completion,
          and it looks nothing like the original rough draft. This project is copyrighted by "Ensitefinancial.com"
          and "GoDaddy Design Services".

            <h3>4.) "Lister"</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
        Developed by myself and my Codercamps classmates Joe Waynick and Suzanne
        Federico. Using the "Agile Methodology", we worked as a small Dev Team and
        created this very powerful business tool! Lister is a web app that can be
        used by any online entrepreneur who wishes to leverage the power of Amazon
        to sell products. Lister interfces with Amazon's complex API and makes it
        much faster and easier to upload and list your products for sale. This app
        will save you many hours weekly, and free up your time to do all of the other
        important business processes you might have on your agenda.

            This is my first published Website! I spent about 6 weeks developing this Full-Stack
            Website. As a Coder Camps student it was required that I complete this individual
            project in class. I decided to choose the specific subject matter based upon something
            that meant something to me personally. As an indepandant business person prior to
            attending Coder Camps I was Co-Owner of this business.
